## Set-up
### Hardware
ESP32 board ("WeMos" D1 R32 in our case) with MicroPython.  
[Hardware layout](http://hobbycomponents.com/images/forum/wemos/Wemos_D1_HCWEMO0001_Diagram.png)  
[Pinout](https://cdn.instructables.com/FFU/YFXC/JIAJNA26/FFUYFXCJIAJNA26.LARGE.jpg)
#### Firmware
[MicroPython firmware download page](https://micropython.org/download#esp32)  
For purposes of our workshop, please download following: 
 - Download link 
    - Based on: [esp32-ppp-fix.bin](https://micropython.org/resources/firmware/esp32-ppp-fix.bin) (most recent today - 2019-05-23)
    - Embedded with uasyncio and aswitch libraries
    - With script to connect network and sync RTC via NTP on boot

### Software
#### Drivers
Windows: If the drivers for CH430 are not installed automatically, thay can be obtained [here ](https://wiki.wemos.cc/_media/ch341ser_win_3.4.zip)  
linux / MAC: ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
#### IDE
[Thonny IDE](https://thonny.org/) was picked for this workshop. Reasons? Can be installed via pip, automatically detects and handles COM communication and allows us to flash firmware, so we don't have to utilize any other application.  
Getting the IDE: 
 - [Thonny IDE Download Page](https://github.com/thonny/thonny/releases)  
 or
 - `pip3 install thonny` and `python3 -m thonny`

Setting it up for ESP32:
 - install thonny-esp plug-in
    - Tools > Manage Plug-Ins > `thonny-esp`> install
    - restart Thonny IDE 
 - Tools > Options > Interpreter > MicroPython on ESP32

There are other IDEs, like [uPyCraft](http://docs.dfrobot.com/upycraft/) or you can utilize low-level approach via [ampy](https://github.com/pycampers/ampy) & [esptool](https://github.com/espressif/esptool/blob/master/README.md).

## Input/Output
[io.py](io.py) - code related to following I/O operations
### Output
Built-in onboard LED is connected to Pin2. Let's try to turn it on and off.  
`>>> io.blink()`
### Input
#### Blocking
We're periodically checking for state change of the pin in a loop. Also the application won't respond to the user while it's running the loop. Although the functions sets both buttons, the program stucks on the checking loop for the first.  
`>>> io.test_blocking_input()`
#### Non-blocking, IRQ
Utilizes hardware interrupts. When state change on the pin is detected, interrupt is raised and calls the function binded to it.  
`>>> io.test_non_blocking_irq()`
#### Non-blocking, uasyncio
libraries needed: [uasyncio](https://github.com/peterhinch/micropython-async) and [aswitch](https://github.com/peterhinch/micropython-async/blob/master/aswitch.py). See [Sidenotes > Libraries installation](#libraries-installation)  
Takes advantage of asynchronous programming, which allows to run multiple tasks in parallel.  
aswitch library has built-in class for pushbutton, which correctly handles click, double-click, long press and filters out the button bounces.  
`asyncio.await()` in the `async_tick_tock()` pauses the cycle execution, so asyncio can run other tasks queued in the asyncio event loop.  
`>>> io.test_non_blocking_asyncio()`
## Connectivity
### Automatic WiFi connection and RTC clock sync
More details available [here](https://techtutorialsx.com/2017/06/06/esp32-esp8266-micropython-automatic-connection-to-wifi/)
### API calls
#### GET request
#### POST/PUT request

## Troubleshooting
###
**Error Numbers** https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib/blob/master/errno/errno.py
#### `IndexError: list index out of range`
Any operation requiring operational network connection (NTP, API requests, ...) can throw `IndexError: list index out of range`  
**Solution**: Make sure your network connection is working properly.

#### Issues with urequests.put()
```py
> urequsts.put("https://....")

mbedtls_ssl_handshake error: -4290
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users\Fred\ESP\api_put.py", line 29, in <module>
  File "urequests.py", line 114, in put
  File "urequests.py", line 96, in request
  File "urequests.py", line 60, in request
OSError: [Errno 5] EIO
```
Application successfully sent one PUT request, then died with following error. Seems to be caused by lack of RAM on the ESP per https://github.com/micropython/micropython-esp32/issues/209.  
**Solution:** `.close()` the connection manually prior starting another request. (For multiple parallel HTTPS connections look for ESP32 with SPI RAM )  
  &nbsp;
 ```py  
OSError: 23
ENFILE = 23 # File table overflow
Close the connection with .close() when you're done with it.
'connection' : 'close' in headers is not sufficient
```
Application sent succesfully 10 requests. Failed on 11th.
**Solution:** Same as previous. Close each connection manually with `.close()` prior starting a new one.

Both issues requires manually calling `.close()` on the urequests session object.  
Having `'connection' : 'close'`in request headers is not sufficient!


## Sidenotes
[MicroPython API reference](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp32/quickref.html)

### Libraries installation
**Automatic**  
```py
import upip
upip.install('micropython-uasyncio')
```
**Manual download**  
`%upload <source> <target>` is a Thonny IDE built-in command
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peterhinch/micropython-async/master/aswitch.py
%upload aswitch.py aswitch.py
```

### Memory management
```py
import gc
print('Free RAM: %.2f kB' % (gc.mem_free()/1024))
gc.collect()
print('Free RAM: %.2f kB' % (gc.mem_free()/1024))
```
### MD5 keys for devices
```py
import hashlib
devs = ["device0"+str(i) for i in range(0,10)]
hashes = [hashlib.md5(d.encode("utf-8")).hexdigest() for d in devs]
db = dict([(devs[i],hashes[i]) for i in range(0, len(devs))])
for d, h in db.items():
    print(d,h)
```
